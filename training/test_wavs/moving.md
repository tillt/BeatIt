- Path: `training/moving.wav`
- Status: current sparse-window result is accepted
- Tempo (BPM): `124.999` (current CPU sparse-window result)
- First downbeat sample frame: `1104`
- Current dedicated regression:
  - narrow canonical test
  - BPM sanity
  - first downbeat timing
  - default 4/4 structure
- Note:
  - the player impression is that tempo, drift, and downbeat are all correct
  - analyzer-wide nearest-peak offsets currently overstate the interior error on this file and are not used as hard truth here
